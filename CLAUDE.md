# Founder Tea

## Supabase

- **Project Name**: founder-tea
- **Project ID**: `vansaiveqynjsuojnogi`

## Development Rules

- Never run `npm run build` - tell me when you want a visual test, I'm running in dev mode in the background
- **Migrations**: Always write migration files to `supabase/migrations/` first. Do NOT apply migrations directly via the Supabase MCP tool without creating the file first. Let the user review before applying.
